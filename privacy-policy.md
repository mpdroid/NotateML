**Notate ML Privacy Notice**

Last updated January 23, 2022


Notate ML is a mobile application that helps create datasets for training "Object Detection" machine learning models. 

- Notate ML does not require or access any of your personal information.
- Notate ML does not track or collect any usage data.
- Notate ML stores the last visited dataset and dataset image in device local storage, and uses this to let you resume your work from the previous session.
- Notate ML requires access to your device camera to capture photos for your datasets. It will ask for your permission to access the camera on first use of the feature. If you choose to decline, you can grant access at a later date using the device's "Settings" feature.
- Notate ML provides the ability to import photos from your device library into your datasets. It uses Apple's "Photo Picker" feature that restricts the application's access to only those photos selected by you for import.
- Notate ML uses crash logs made available through Apple App Store to diagnose issues that users may experience in the app.
